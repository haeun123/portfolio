    	<h1><a name="overview"></a>SHFIT App</h1>
        <p>While flexibility in scheduling and work hours is growing more popular in the workspace, swapping shifts amongst employees can be a disorganized process. The Shfit app addresses the issues of matching skill level, communication, and confusion in scheduling and exchanging shifts amongst gym employees by streamlining shift swapping, scheduling, and communication amongst employees and managers in one virtual space.</p>

    	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    	<p>Our team (Course: Interaction Design Overview, HCII CMU) was tasked to design a native mobile app in a funnel design process to allow for better shift swapping amongst employees. </p>

        <h3>Team</h3>
        <p>Holly Park, Kearnie Lin, Duoduo Zhang, Aileen Yu</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I worked with a team on all parts of the design process, specifically - competitive analysis, interview with a business owner, part of customer journey, manager persona, identifying manager-side issues into UX solutions, wireframes for messaging/notifying, flowchart, refinement of stylized screens for messaging and chatting, inVision prototyping, user testing, iterating, and the final pitch.</p>

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>10/24/2018 - 12/05/2018</p>

    	<h2><a name="comp-analysis"></a>Research and Competitive Analysis</h2>

    	<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>We looked at several top competitors for existing shift swapping applications, as well as the discussion and research insights surrounding their effectiveness and how well these app's features fit into the business context. We aimed to understand the existing issues around shift swapping and schedule instability, and how the features of these competititor applications have aimed to address these issues.</p>

        <h4>Shyft</h4>
        <p>Shyft is used in retail, restaurant, and service environments. It is used by 12,000 Starbucks employees, over 7,500 McDonalds employees, and over 3,500 Old Navy employees.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows workers to get rid of shifts, pick up extra ones</li>
            <li>can connect workers who live in the same general area but in different stores</li>
            <li>allows managers to approve or deny a shift swap</li>
            <li>some managers utilized Shyft by posting entire schedules on the app, allowing employees to choose their schedules.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Shift Messenger</h4>
        <p>Shift messenger was used by The Gap company in an experiment, which led to useful insights on shift swapping apps in the business context.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Saved 10/hours a week by removing the need for employees to make individual phone calls to each other when swapping shifts</li>
            <li>Led to a decrease in no-shows</li>
            <li>Feature: No manager approval required for swapping shifts with the app</li>
            <li><b>Issue: Some managers disliked the app due to the variable quality in their teams; shift swapping with employees with insufficient training for the role is a problem</b></li>
            <li><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/how-the-gap-used-an-app-to-give-workers-more-control-over-their-schedules"><em>Click here for the experiment with The Gap</em></a></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Crew Messaging and Scheduling</h4>
        <p>Crew has been used by RPM Pizza, which operates 190 Domino's Pizzas in various states.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved accountability: shows managers which employees saw which messages</li>
            <li>Experiment saw higher engagement with millenials due to social space-like features - dashboard, individual and group messaging</li>
            <li>Double-digit sales growth with RPM</li>
            <li>23% increase in on-time store deliveries with RPM</li>
            <li>Coverage for vacant shifts increased from 15-20% to 75-80%</li>
            <li><a href="https://crewapp.com/c/resources/eliminate-shift-swap-headache/"><em>Click here for the experiment with RPM Pizza</em></a></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sling</h4>
        <p>Sling is another app that allows for various work-related features in a single platform.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Newsfeed: "social space" quality</li>
            <li>Shift scheduling</li>
            <li>Messaging: direct and group</li>
            <li>Tasks feature</li>
            <li><a href="https://getsling.com/features/"><em>Click here for Sling Features</em></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Increasing communication around scheduling was important, as well as accountability. Some of these apps have implemented a "social media" aspect into their applications successfully. It is important that managers have the option to approve shifts, after employees have been able to easily navigate shift swapping amongst themselves on a single platform. However, within shift swapping it seemed critical to address the issue of variable training/skill level amongst employees - a key issue that further affects customers and business needs.</p>

    	<h3><a name="interviews"></a>Interviews</h3>
        <p>My teammates conducted interviews with former and current gym workers (of other gyms and at Carnegie Mellon University), and I interviewed an owner of a franchise. Our purpose was to better understand the experiences of employees and managers around exchanging shifts in the workplace</p>

        <h4>Justin: 24, former trainer at a gym</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Goes to manager to ask to swap shifts, or...</li>
            <li>Contacts coworker to see which swaps are possible, then proposes to manager (in order to reduce work for the manager</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Jeff: 53, owner of a cleaning and restoration franchise</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Usually swap shifts by checking the schedule and approaching the employee in person at work</li>
            <li>Difficult to swap shifts when unable to find the right caliber of employee to take over the role</li>
            <li>Employees do not use any technologies to swap shifts</li>
            <li>Employees swap shifts for on-call times, such as Friday nights when they have an event to go to</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>At CMU Gym:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no app that schedules shifts for different jobs</li>
            <li>There is an internal website for CMU students to schedule their shifts on - DoSportsEasy</li>
            <li>Lifeguards at the pool use SubItUp to schedule and substitute shifts.</li>
        </ul>

    	<h3><a name="additional-research"></a>Additional Research</h3>
        <p>We conducted further secondary research to discover common employee scheduling problems and potential solutions.
        <ul>
            <li>Communication, verification, and organization is key to resolve shift swapping confusion and no-shows</li>
            <li>Need to prevent a situation where a qualified employee might switch with a junior employee, leading to lack of experienced workers on duty</li>
            <li>With a shift swapping software, the employee should be notified by the system if the swap has been accepted by the replacement employee, and managers should have the ability to approve such requests.</li>
        </ul>

    	<h2><a name="personas"></a>Personas</h2>
        <p>I was responsible for creating Todd Peterson's persona, based on the interview I conducted with an owner and other research.</p>

        <h3>Jocelyn Goforth</h3>
        <p>Lifeguard, Carnegie Mellon University pool</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/shfit/jocelyn.png">
        </div>
        <p><em>“Just keep swimming, just keep swimming”</em></p>
        <p>Jocelyn Goforth is one of the lifeguards at Carnegie Mellon University’s Aquatics Center. Originally hailing from Lincoln, Nebraska, she is 20 years old and majors in Information Systems. She is a member of CMU’s Varsity Swim team and her achievements include qualifying for NCAA Nationals. </p>
        <p>As a busy and committed college student, SubItUp or DoSportsEasy helps her remember to schedule and drop shifts on a moment’s notice.</p>
        <p>However, she wishes the University could consolidate these two platforms for easier use. Both interfaces are also hard to navigate and are unappealing to the user, thus causing her to miss out on shifts she could pick up and preventing people from picking her unattended shifts up. </p>
        <p>Her long-term goal is to make the transition of changing, trading, and picking up shifts seamlessly which would thus reduce the stress of the aquatics director and ensure safety on the pool deck. </p>

        <h3>Matt Terrell</h3>
        <p>27, Gym Attendant, Weights Room</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/shfit/matt.png">
        </div>
        <p><em>“The greatest reward is being able to ensure the safety of people who are working towards their goal body.”</em></p>
        <p>After obtaining his degree in physical therapy, Matt works primarily as a physical trainer while juggling gym attendant duties on the side during certain shifts. Because of this flexibility, he constantly has to figure out what time slots are eligible each week for both training sessions and for spotting the weight room in the gym. </p>
        <p>His main concern with the current scheduling software is that the calendar does not display when the shifts of the other employees are, so whenever he has to request a change to accommodate his lessons, he has to reach out to coworkers individually, mostly just based off of guesswork and luck; on the other hand, when others want to trade shifts, he will often receive unproductive calls regarding the matter when he wishes that time would be saved if they could just see first-hand in the interface that none of his times can work elsewhere. </p>
        <p>He also wishes that the interface could be customized and enhanced with weighted features denoting the skill level or specialization of certain specs that are recommended with a current shift; for instance, there have been slight worries with less equipped employees taking over for his shift because of their different weight classes, which may pose a concern if there is an accident and a fallen weight cannot be recovered as quickly as possible. Matt figures that a way to write notes to denote some sort of minimum skill level or shift description per timeblock would be beneficial to the gym staff.</p>

        <h3>Todd Peterson</h3>
        <p>43, Owner-manager, medium-sized restaurant in NYC</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/shfit/todd.png">
        </div>
        <p><em>“Days off are few and far between in the restaurant business. But on an hour off, I like to have a glass of wine with my wife.”</em></p>
        <p>Todd Peterson is the owner and manager at a restaurant. He is 53 years old, and works often at 40-50 hours a week both managing and leading his business. </p>
        <p>Todd finds himself very busy focusing on short term responsibilities including managing employees, food quality, customer service, tracking sales and other miscellaneous tasks.</p>
        <p>His restaurant has a good amount of employees in each area: servers, cooks, etc. As an owner-manager, he spends a good amount of time trying to coordinate schedules and shifts when an employee wants to change their shift times with someone else who may not be at the same caliber of skill for that shift. He wants to be able to manage these concerns in a more organized, efficient and immediate manner.</p>
        <p>Todd hopes to be able to save time and effort on day-to-day tasks and improve the business with small steps, so that he can focus more on expanding his restaurant to reach the long-term goals he envisions as an owner. </p>

        <h3>Joseph Cooper</h3>
        <p>27, Pharmacist at CVS Pharmacy</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/shfit/joseph.png">
        </div>
        <em>“Yeah, I should be free… if Jeffrey doesn’t text me tomorrow asking to trade shifts.”</em>
        <p>Joseph is a practicing pharmacist at CVS and generally adheres to a standard schedule by default by working every other day. What happens sometimes is that his peers request to swap shifts because of conflicts, and this issue is communicated directly with the manager; other times, the coworkers may reach out to him directly via any communication method such as text, calling, email, or social media, all depending on the closeness between them. </p>
        <p>If the shift swapping request is communicated with the manager first, sometimes if the response isn’t as immediate, Joseph doesn’t learn of the request until shorter notice, which leads to stress and possible rescheduling of his already planned day, or perhaps just him having to decline the request which puts weight on the pharmacy as a whole. If the coworker reaches out to him directly, there is the chance that Joseph is just offline or busy at the moment and does not react to the message until later. </p>
        <p>Joseph wishes that there were a systemized and streamlined procedure incorporated into the pharmacy at work to better track and communicate these shift swapping requests. A few of the things that he would appreciate are efficiency and automaticity, as well as more noticeable and responsive notifications for quick and seamless conversion rates for shift handling scenarios. He also imagines that it would be useful to be able to request swaps from multiple people or have automatic suggestion and handling of other people’s shifts that are suggested for trade rather than deciding each eligible timeblock manually. </p>

    <!-- Scenarios---------->
    	<h2><a name="scenarios"></a>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>Based on these customer journeys and personas, we created four scenarios to encapsulate the issues that employees and managers may face in scheduling / shift swapping, and how our proposed application may resolve these.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>[Jocelyn Goforth] Jocelyn is often in a hurry and constantly forgets when her shift is coming up for lifeguarding. Navigating to the website to look up or sign up for her shift is a hassle, since she’s always on the move and typing/looking at her phone is never convenient. The interface is also extremely bland- making options and tasks hard to find. Thus, Jocelyn constantly sleeps through her shifts because she’s never well informed on when they are. However, with a new and improved app, Jocelyn will have push reminders before her shift starts. The interface will also be adjusted so it flows in a logical manner and different operations are easier to find.</li>
            <li>[Matt Terrell] Matt has a client that requested to reschedule their training session for a different timeblock than originally planned; the new, preferred schedule overlaps Matt’s shift for spotting the weight room, so he toggles his slot in the team calendar on the app to open it for availability and set his status as requesting a swap, and toggles his coworkers’ blocks that work for him. Because of the necessary skill and experience level for handling weights, he pins a required skill level in the description modal of his time block such that only eligible coworkers can request a swap. When his coworkers see his alerted slot on the team calendar, they will be able to offer a swap with a block that Matt had prerequested, and then send a notification to his device.</li>
            <li>[Steve Johnson] As a gym manager, Steve needs to ensure that employees fulfill their shifts and efficiently do their jobs to ensure the satisfaction of gym members. Sometimes, employees are unable to make it to an assigned shift or try to swap shifts with incompatible employees. Then, Steve’s approval is requested nearly last minute, making him unable to decline or to try to find a better swap. This often leads to no-shows or inefficiency in how tasks are handled. Todd gets stressed out by this situation, as this further muddles his responsibilities as a manager. Our app’s calendar feature will allow Steve to share everyone’s scheduled shifts and their tasks with employees, so that they can effectively figure out which coworkers are available to swap shifts.</li>
            <li>Susie can only work half of her shifts tomorrow because she needs to take one hour off. She hopes that someone from the following shift will come in a bit early to cover the second half of her shift. Susie finds it difficult to split a shift in two in the app settings and has to contact other coworkers via phone/email. To solve the problem, our APP provides Split Shift feature, which allows people to split their shifts and swap or drop the shift that has been split.</li>
        </ol>

    	<h2><a name="prioritized-features"></a>Prioritized Features List</h2>
        <p>We created a list of prioritized features based on careful study of existing applications and UI trends.</p>
        <p>Key Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dashboard/Home [Employee]</li>
            <li>Calendar + Requirements for shift descriptions</li>
            <li>Directory</li>
            <li>Group Messaging/Inbox</li>
            <li>Announcements + Notifications</li>
            <li>Swap History & Pending approvals</li>
            <li>Profile/ Summary of work hours</li>
            <li>Dashboard/Home [Admin]</li>
            <li>Notification [Admin]</li>
            <li>Mass messaging to all employees</li>
        </ul>

    	<h2><a name="brainstorming"></a>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p>As a team, we brainstormed with these key features and common issues we discovered with our research in mind to draft wireframes and develop the user experience.</p>
        <div id="brainstorm-container" class="img-container">
            <img src="images/shfit/brainstorm1.jpg">
            <img src="images/shfit/brainstorm2.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Our app would have an admin and employee side such that shift swap requests would be notified to the manager for approval (pending approval notification), as well as to the employee whose shift would be taken over. We would include a month/week/daily calendar for regular employee scheduling and checking (increasing accountability amongst employees), and promote communication through the group and individual chatting feature. In addition, a dashboard with summaries with a half screen feature would allow the user to see his/her daily responsibilities and calendar through a half-screen feature that may possibly swap/scroll up. Through the directory, employees would easily find employees, see their training and skill level and contact them immediately through the messaging features. All features should be easily accessible through a toolbar and interconnected in an intuitive way, which we drafted through our wireframe sketches/flow.</p>

    	<h2><a name="wireframes"></a>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I took responsibility over creating wireframes for the admin side, pending approvals, calendar, and messaging/chatting.</p>
        <div class="img-container">

        </div>

        <h3><a name="flowchart"></a>Flowchart</h3>
        <p>I put our wireframes into a single flowchart demonstrating how users would navigate our app to complete certain tasks such as messaging others, checking notifications, swapping shifts, and scheduling their workweek in advance.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/shfit/Flowchart.jpg">
        </div>
        
    	<h2><a name="proto-test"></a>Prototype and Testing</h2>
        <p>We created a lo-fi prototype with our wireframes using InVision and tested Hanyu (user 1) and Stephanie (user 2), two students at CMU. We asked them to complete certain tasks that an employee or admin may want to do using the prototype.</p>

        <p>These were our prompts for our user tests:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>As an employee, you want to look more specifically at your schedule. Navigate to your planned schedule for the week of November 16th.</li>
            <li>. As an employee, you want to swap shifts with someone quickly, so you decide to send a message. Where would you do this?</li>
            <li>As the administrator, you want to communicate with all your employees. How would you do that?</li>
            <li>. As an administrator, you need to approve or deny certain shift swaps. How would you get there?</li>
            <li>As an administrator, you want to see all the shifts for November 16th. How do you get there?</li>
            <li>As an administrator, how and where would you find a list of all your employees?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Results/ Insights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>User 2 found completing prompt 1 to be a bit difficult/unclear: viewing the week's schedule vs. inputing their scheduling for future weeks need to be differentiated better.</li>
            <li>User 2 found prompt 2 unclear: chatting vs. inbox features are conflicting and need to be distinguished.</li>
            <li>Need to make navigating across days vs. weeks on the calendar clearer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on our user tests, we found that overall our system/flow was intuitive, yet we needed to better distinguish between scheduling and checking existing schedules on the calendar as well as improving the flow between chatting, notifications, and inbox. </p>
