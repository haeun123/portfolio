		<h1><a name="overview"></a>Treasure Run</h1>
		<p>Bringing Regent Square together through a year-long "treasure hunt" service in which newer residents can discover the neighborhood and the accompanying stories of long-time residents.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Treasure Run is a year-long service occuring in Regent Square. Delivered through physical and digital channels, this service guides newer residents through multiple locations in the city - businesses, historic sites, and more - where they unlock stories and media from long-time residents about their experiences in the area. At the end of the journey awaits the long-cherished block parties of Regent Square, where new residents can finally meet and mingle with the existing residents that have helped them to feel more connected to the neighborhood.</p>

		<h3>Timeline: 4/15/19 - 5/1/19 (2 weeks)</h3>
		<h3>Task</h3>
		<p><p>Our team (Course: Designing for Service; Carnegie Mellon University) was tasked to design a city-scale service for Regent Square in Pennsylvania - a neighborhood made up of four separate municipalities - Pittsburgh, Edgewood, Swissvale, and Wilkinsburg. </p></p>
		<h3>My Role</h3>
		<p>I worked with my team on all parts of the service design process. Specifically, I shared responsibility for observation, interviews, brainstorming and ideation, development of our service concept, prototyping, service blueprinting, part of the value exchange, and concept video.</p>

		<h3>Tools</h3>
		<p>Adobe Illustrator, Procreate, Google slides</p>

		<h2><a name="research"></a>Research</h2>
		<h3><a name="observation"></a>Field Observations</h3>
		<p>We began by setting out and exploring Regent Square as a team. We sought out to better understand the people, businesses, events, and space of the city in order to get a glance at any potential for improvement through service design.</p>

		<p>Through our observational excursion, we found a neighborhood with a quaint atmosphere - full of history, nature, and eclectic houses and businesses.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lots of mom-and-pop businesses: culturally diverse restaurants, variety of stores, dentists, salons, etc.</li>
			<li>Historical buildings and sites</li>
			<li>Mix of young and old people</li>
			<li>Lots of people walking dogs</li>
			<li>Lots of cars - crossing the road was difficult</li>
			<li>Found Frick Park - large historical park in Pittsburgh - as part of the neighborhood</li>
			<li>Drainage problems in some streets</li>
		</ul>

		<h3><a name="interview"></a>Interviews</h3>
		<p>In order to get more insight into life in Regent Square, we interviewed three long term residents who discussed their experiences in the neighborhood through phone call.</p>

		<h3>Insights and Potential Directions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bureaucratic/ money issues due to different municipalities: Regent Square is a neighborhood made up of parts of the municipalities of Pittsburgh, Edgewood, Swissvale, and Wilkinsburg.</li>
			<li>Drainage Problems: Regent square has started experiencing a lot of drainage problems, and these have not been addressed.</li>
			<li>Common usage of Frick Park: The park, playground, Wilkins School, and Edgewood Town Center are shared with the rest of Swissvale and Wilkinsburg.</li>
			<li>Run Around The Square: Annual 5K event residents look forward to; runs through neighborhood streets and ends in Frick Park</li>
			<li>Yearly yard sale: Large, publicized springtime community-wide yearly garage sale hosted by the RSCA.</li>
			<li>Influx of new residents now residing with older residents: "Regent Square is made up of many new residents, as well as those that have been there for decades"</li>
			<li>Block parties: Large part of Regent Square's culture- "excuse for residents to hang out and have fun"</li>
			<li>"Lots of dog owners"</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="brainstorming"></a>Brainstorming/ Ideation</h2>
		<p>While we were limited in tackling drainage or bureaucratic problems, we saw possibility in better connecting residents to their city and to each other.</p>

	    <p>We aimed to conceptualize a service that would bring together old and new residents - potentially by supporting and intersecting with the highly cherished annual events (i.e., yard sale, 5k, block parties), its small businesses, or highlighting the historic value of the neighborhood.</p>

		<h2><a name="developing-service-idea"></a>Our Service Concept</h2>
		<p>With these goals in mind, we brainstormed to develop a service concept/scenarios in which users can engage with each other and the city facilitated by our service touchpoints. Some of our ideas included:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Use of mobile AR technology to show the changes in a location of Regent Square over time - such as its row houses</li>
			<li>Facilitating a yard sale event - add meaning/value to items</li>
			<li>Incorporating a treasure hunt in the 5K annual run</li>
			<li>Using the theatre as a space for sharing videos and stories</li>
			<li></li>
			<li>Older residents contribute "treasure hunt" tasks for participants (new residents) - i.e., "find Frick Park and look for a specific spot which marks a memorable event, etc.</li>
			<li>Incorporating Regent Square's culture - its block parties into the end of a treasure hunt-type service</li>
		</ol>

		<p>We narrowed our concept idea to 1, 5, and 6, taking the idea of a treasure hunt experience throughout the neighborhood, in which block party hosts and older residents insert their narrative into a digital archive. We crafted a system of a series of visits throughout Regent Square, in which newer residents are introduced to a variety of locations that have personal value or background story to a host resident. 

		<p>At one "treasure" location such as an elementary school, a resident may unlock an AR photo archive showing how the school looked like when the "host" or older resident attended, or a voice recording provided by the "host" resident giving a short story about their experience at the school. Or, the participant might find themselves at Biddle's Cafe, and their task might be to find the host's favorite barista. The timeline of the treasure hunt ends when the block party hosted by the older resident(s) begin, allowing both parties to meet and bond.</p>

		<h3><a name="scenarios"></a>Scenarios</h3>
		<p>Our team created rough scenarios to better understand/visualize the user journey.</p>

		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/treasure-run/beginning-scenario.jpeg">
		</div>
		<p>On ‘Treasure Day’, the vending machines in the neighbourhood have Maps available that participants can use to start the adventure, marking various spots in the neighborhood in which a specific task is to be completed. The back of the map displays different journeys that participants can choose based on their interest.</p>

		<p>Participants scan the QR code of the story they want to play that takes them to a digital app. As they travel to different locations using the map, the corresponding tasks/ directions are unlocked.</p>

	    <p>Each year, a specific block takes ownership of the game, personalizing it to what they want to spotlight.</p>

		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/treasure-run/businesses-scenario.jpeg">
		</div>
		<p>One scenario of how the service could be used is to share a personal experience relating to the businesses in the neighborhood. One such task a host resident may provide could be to find the best coffee in Biddle Ave, and enjoy it on a walk in the nearby Frick Park. This could promote businesses, and connect residents through shared experience and similar interests.</p>

		<p>Another task could be to find the special antique store Le Mix, find a special section that had some sentimental value to the task creator/resident, and talk to the owner to get more insight into how the store began.</p>

		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/treasure-run/historical-scenario.jpeg">
		</div>
		<p>The service could be used to share the personal life and stories of a longtime resident. The participant might be led to, for example, this person’s childhood home. The digital app would detect their location, prompting the participant to begin listening to a story prerecorded by the resident. The app can also present photographs, allowing the user to see what this place used to look like, further connecting them to the resident.</p>

	    <p>The participant would be prompted to take their own photograph of the place, contribute to the archives– this photograph might be used in another Regent Square Treasure Run 50 years from now.</p>

		</div>
		The adventure finalizes in the form of a block party thrown by the block that created the journey, encouraging different residents around Regent Square to visit each other. The participants can meet the hosts who set up the journey, resulting in new connections/understanding, connection to various parts of the neighborhood, and thus a stronger community.

		<h2><a name="prototyping"></a>Prototyping</h2>
		<p>In addition, we tested out our idea with props to demonstrate resident interactions with our service touchpoints.</p>

		<h2>The Map</h2>
		<p>My teammate created the physical map of Regent Square depicting various sample locations that the user would travel to in order to complete the treasure hunt tasks. We wanted to give it a historic look (initial idea was to dip the paper in coffee) to enhance the theme of the user discovering past narratives throughout the journey.</p>

		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/treasure-run/Map.jpg">
		</div>

		<h2><a name="service-blueprint"></a>Service Blueprint</h2>
		<p>I created a service blueprint to better understand the details of our service concept, and identify any potential issues between the back-end delivery of our service and the user journey.</p>
		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/treasure-run/blueprint.png">
		</div>
		<p>Our primary users - specifically newer residents in the locality - are those that participate in the completing of tasks set by block residents throughout the journey. As designers, we deliver the physical and digital channels by which the service will delivered to the block residents- the vending machine and basic app, who decide on the specifics of the touchpoints and provide their recordings and photographs.</p>
		<p>This finalized journey is then delivered to users, and by the time they are completing tasks, the affordances of the basic app - such as location tracking, media input, displaying media from the archives - facilitate the journey. At the end of the annual Treasure Run, these participants and block residents finally interact face to face at the corresponding block's party.</p>
		<p>We had also thought about creating more real-time interaction between block residents and participants throughout the journey, such as receiving a direct phone call from a block resident at a specific location. However, this had the potential of causing awkwardness such as time-conflicts and intrusion. Thus, each task can be completed at any time, and pre-recoded clips/stories would be released instead of direct calls.</p>

		<h2><a name="value-exchanges"></a>Value Exchanges Between Stakeholders</h2>
		<p>Our service allows for the exchange of experiential value, monetary value, and connection amongst stakeholders. Block residents who contribute to the design of the journey provide stories, advice, and new experiences to Treasure Run participants, who in turn provide them with connection and potential friendship. Participants also provide business owners monetary value, who in turn provide them their services.</p>

		<h2><a name="video"></a>Concept Video</h2>
		<p>Our video demonstrates a Treasure Run participant's journey as they discover the life of a fictional Regent Square resident, Edith - while exploring areas of the neighborhood. Our teammate wrote the specifics of her life story:</p>
		<a href="https://medium.com/design-for-service-team-5885/regent-square-ediths-story-4eed9c6b582"><b>Read: Edith's Life</b></a>

		<p>Based on her fictional life, we created a script for a concept video in which Edith's pre-recoded stories play throughout multiple locations that the user visits in Regent Square.</p>
		<a href="Treasure Run - Journey video script.pdf" target="_Blank"><b>Read: video script/ Edith's Treasure Run recordings</b></a> <!-- EDITH STORY, SCRIPT LINKS -->

		<p>We visisted Regent Square one last time to take photographs at various locations, and created a concept video portraying the user experience as they visit various locations - from Edith's house to Biddle's Escape cafe - and unlock stories and historical photographs from Edith.</p>
