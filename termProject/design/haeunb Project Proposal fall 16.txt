My program will be a side-scrolling game based on a underwater
setting where the user will navigate through and interact with
randomly and purposefully generated predators/obstacles to win.
As the player advances in level and scores higher, the predator entities
become more complex and sophisticated in their interaction with 
the user to create a more challenging experience until the player
achieves a certain level of criteria and wins.
I will not use any other modules besides tkinter to create this
program. I hope to randomize the details, but overall have levels
and a sense of a path in my game that makes it an ideal balance 
between strictly hardcoded games and soley score-based repetitive
side scrollers. 
In order to have the player interact with more complex obstacles/
predators as the level goes up, I will have to implement some sort
of simulated AI to have the game be more interactive with the user.
