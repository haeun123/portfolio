I reduced the redundancy of my project in general
by getting rid of the extra / "flying" mode, which 
didn't truly seem to be necessary and that time would 
be better off spent enhancing the features of a primary
mode of the game. 
Since I am not using pyGame anymore, I updated the 
Project proposal from TP1 to accomodate these changes.
I also elaborated on the more important main features 
I have been working on.
