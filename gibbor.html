    	<h1><a name="overview"></a>Gibbor: AHAVA Memory Care Residence</h1>
    	<p>Located at the Jewish Association on Aging, AHAVA Memory Care Residence is an innovative program that seeks to provide fulfilling and holistic care for those with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. It takes on The Hearthstone Institute's <em>I'm Still Here</em> approach developed by Dr. John Ziesel, which focuses on creating a nurturing environment empathetically designed for dementia patients' needs while allowing them freedom and individuality to flourish.</p>
    	<p>"Gibbor" is the Hebrew term for "hero". The name of our solution is inspired by the staff at AHAVA Memory Care residence, who work hard to provide caring assistance to its residents and make sure they maintain enriching and fulfilling lives. Gibbor aims to raise employee appreciation at AHAVA through employee-centered events that occur weekly in the existing structure of activities in the AHAVA curriculum. Our solution aims to increase employee satisfaction by allowing a channel that will increase their presence and sense of feeling appreciated, while making their work more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>Our project spanned from research to rough solution ideation. Through field research, interviews, and identification of needs and problems at the residence, we designed a solution that would address lack of employee appreciation at AHAVA as well as resident frustrations.</p>

        <h3>Team</h3>
        <p>Holly Park, Sachi Shah, Gyueun Park</p>

    	<h3>My Role</h3>
    	<p>I worked with my team on all parts of the process including: observation, interview notetaker, all stakeholder personas, visual design in phase 1, identifying pain points/needs, solutions, storyboarding, and presentations</p>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Sketch, Procreate</p>

    	<h3>Timeline</h3>
    	<p>1/24/19 - 2/05/19; 3/05/19 - 3/26/19</p>

    	<h2><a name="process"></a>Process</h2>

    	<h3><a name="observations"></a>Field Research: Observation</h3>
        <p>We were assigned AHAVA Memory Care Residence for our target context, and its residents, family members, and staff as our target users. At our first visit to the AHAVA residence, we recieved a tour of the interior design decisions by director Amy Duke, then our team split up to do independent fly-on-the-wall observations. During our second visit, we observed resident and employee interactions throughout daily activities.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/gibbor/schedule.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="img-container">

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/gibbor/booth-2.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Some of our observations were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Some residents reluctantly wheeled from TV room to lunchroom despite protests/confusion</li>
            <li>Residents disliking meal options (3 options available at lunch)</li>
            <li>Most residents used wheelchairs, which caused difficulty/awkwardness when sitting at dining room tables</li>
            <li>Individualized suites for each resident</li>
            <li>Varying activities such as accordion player, spa day, structured throughout the day</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>Residents interact with each other playfully</li>
            <li>Residents expressing frustration when staff try to encourage them to join in on group events/activities</li>
            <li>Empty wall space available at the end of certain hallways</li>
            <li>Activity table booths were set up in the hallways (for residents who might want to stay busy or help out or learn about new things) - these were unused</li>
            <li>Lots of natural lighting, spatial cues for dementia accomodation</li>
            <li>Memory cues - i.e., code for exiting door in nearby picture frame of a jersey</li>
        </ol>

    	<h4><a name="interviews"></a>Interviews with employees</h4>
        <p>During our first visit, we were also able to interview two food preparation staff members and a certified nursing assistant at the residence.</p>
        <p>We found that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certified nursing assistants - say there are a shortage of those who are certified</li>
            <li>would be nice to have more employees on hand - when someone calls off, there is a shortage</li>
            <li>CNA work with residents are relationship based (one-on-one care)</li>
            <li>29 residents live in AHAVA at any time, with a long waitlist</li>
            <li>CNAS feel that the current 29 residents is a lot; canot provide one-on-one care for everyone</li>
            <li>activities are 1 hour- some residents can't pay attention for the entire time</li>
            <li>Each aide is assigned to an activity, which vary each day</li>
            <li>difficult when aides are assigned one-on-one care and an activity at the same time</li>
            <li>food staff employees say they enjoy their work and serving residents</li>
            <li>better activities should be designed, but the structure of programs is limiting</li>
            <li>Aides and CNAs feel that they don't get paid enough</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, while food staff expressed enjoyment with their work, CNAs/aides at the residence felt overworked and underpaid. They felt that the activities needed restructuring, and that they had difficulty managing many responsibilities at once.</p>

    	<h4><a name="stakeholder-map"></a>Stakeholder Map</h4>
        <p>Using our insights from our interviews and observations, we created a rough stakeholder map. Our main stakeholders were residents, their family, and employees at the residence (including CNAs, chefs, managers, private nurses, etc.). Other stakeholders are those who design the AHAVA program and structure - such as Dr. Zohn Ziesel, potential residents on the waitlist, community members of the entire Jewish Assosication of America campus, religious figures such as the rabbi who comes into the residence, researchers, and investors.</p>

    	</div>

    	<h4><a name="personas-empathy"></a>Personas/ Empathy Maps</h4>
    	<p>I designed a fused persona-empathy map for Timothy Roberts- a resident at AHAVA with moderate dementia, Mia Wilson - a daughter of an AHAVA resident, and Mia Wilson - a certified nursing assistant providing one-on-one care and other duties at AHAVA. Our purpose was to better understand the perspective of our stakeholders.</p>

    	<h3><a name="50-problems"></a>50 Problems</h3>
        <p>As a team, we rapidly brainstormed a total of 50 pain points/needs/problems that we observed through our research and interviews disregarding duplicates or overlap at this stage.</p>
    	<div class="img-container">

    	</div>

    	<h4><a name="affinity-clustering"></a>Affinity Clustering</h4>
        <p>After our brainstorming session, we quickly grouped the post-its based on similarity or related underlying themes. We then gave headings each group. Ultimately, our groupings were labeled: Facility Organization/Structure, Activities, Staff, Food, Curriculum, Residents, and Visitors.</p>

    	</div>

    	<h3><a name="50-solutions"></a>50 Solutions</h3>
        <p>With our issues and our user needs in mind, we rapidly generated a total of 50 solutions disregarding feasibility at this point.</p>

    	<h4><a name="feasibility-usefulness"></a>Synthesis: Feasibility / Usefulness Axes</h4>
        <p>We then placed each solution on 2 axes: feasibility and usefulness while discussing each, in order to better understand them and their relative value.</p>

        <h4><a name="narrowing-solutions"></a>Narrowing Solutions</h4>
        <p>As a team, we narrowed our the solutions into those that most directly connected to our observations and had high feasibility/usefulness for our initial case study presentation.</p>
        <p>To address the issues in the resident experience that we observed - encapsulated by persona Timothy Roberts - we decided on two key solutions: making tables in the dining area more wheelchair accessible, and providing an all-day accessible snack bar for those residents we observed that didn't want to eat during mealtime. Our teammate Sachi created these portions of the slides for our presentation.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/gibbor/tim-solutions-1.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>To address the pain points and goals of employees/CNAs at AHAVA - represented by our persona Sarah Miller -  mainly feeling overworked and underappreciated, the solutions would involve having clear and structured designated responsibilities, employee incentives such as "employee of the month", and systematic changes such as having more staff on shift.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/gibbor/sarah-solutions-1.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>To address the needs of family members of AHAVA residents, we felt that it was important to improve their visiting experience, such as by implementing better signage around the AHAVA residence on the larger JAA campus.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/gibbor/mia-solutions-1.jpg">
        </div>

        <h3><a name="scenarios-storyboarding"></a>Scenarios/ Storyboarding</h3>
        <p>With our solutions and users in mind, we created storyboards to envision the user experience in which these solutions would come into play. I created scenarios for the resident solutions -  wheelchair accessible tables at mealtime, and all-say snack bars. Throughout the panels, I conveyed the situation, problem, the emotional state of the stakeholder, the solution, and its emotional impact.</p>

    	<h3><a name="final-solution"></a>Final Solution</h3>
        <p>Through discussion, our team agreed that the most salient issue we had discovered had been the experience of certified nursing assistants at AHAVA. Employees at AHAVA are the overlooked stakeholder, and they have a significant role to play in improving the daily resident experience. We had first hand anecdotes from our interviews showing the pain points of CNAs as they feel overworked and underpaid for their effort, and we observed that their frustration, combined with lack of cooperation from residents, can make for a less optimal sense of community.</p>
        <p>Thus, we aimed to design a final solution that would lead to more autonomy, recognition, and satisfaction for employees at AHAVA. We looked at various ways to implement a space where employees could express themselves while highlighting and recognizing their efforts and individual interests.</p>
        <p>We started with the basic idea of an "employee of the month" wall, but developing it such that it would not lead to more work for employees, but fit in with their existing schedule while allowing for interaction with residents and family, and providing an enjoyable experience that highlights employees' unique interests.</p>
        <p><a name="design-considerations"></a>Some of our considerations in defining our solution were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interventions in existing space</li>
            <li>Recognition walls exist in grocery stores, but often very dry, corporate-y</li>
            <li>Installation to do collaboratively</li>
            <li>How does it fit in and amplify</li>
            <li>A physical extension of something that is done socially or by workers (already existing committee)</li>
            <li>A change to designate time together, bonding of residents, family, employees</li>
            <li>not mandatory/additional work</li>
            <li>How is it being interacted with while on the wall?</li>
            <li>CNA seen as different groups - called “girls” by some family members</li>
            <li>How can the residents take an active role in the process?</li>
            <li>Interviews: CNAs had expressed needing to revitalize existing activities</li>
            <li>CNA - What do they like to do during their free time? </li>
            <li>Giving ownership and flexibility</li>
            <li>Bringing their lifestyles into their workspace by allowing them to come up with activity ideas</li>
            <li>Activity time - within their shifts/work time</li>
            <li>Building connections with residents and families</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We went back to further developing a related solution that I had added earlier during our brainstorming session - a weekly event where an activity is centered on employees' personal interests. This would provide a chance for employees to engage with residents on a deeper level by teaching a hobby they are passionate about, sharing valuable photographs, or more. Family members would be invited into the event, to increase appreciation and strengthening of the community. While this solution wouldn't address how some employees feel underpaid, it would increase recognition and appreciation by giving them autonomy and a structured activity in their work that is enjoyable and allows for self expression. In addition, we had observed many underused empty spaces in the residence that could be designated for these events. Unlike an "employee of the month" wall, this solution would avoid creating more work for employees, allow for bonding and collaboration between residents and staff during the activity, and lighten their workload while increasing autonomy and their presence in the community.</p>

        <p>With our final solution of employee-centered activities, we created a poster that would convey how this solution would highlight the role of the CNA employee and the overlooked importance of their role in the residence. We thus called our solution "Gibbor", a hebrew term conveying "strong, mighty, hero".</p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <a name="final-poster"></a>
            <img src="images/gibbor/gibbor-final.png">
        </div>

        <p>Our teammate Sachi created the art for our final poster, and Gyueun and I wrote the Context, Problem, and Solution portions of our poster.</p>

        <h3><a name="final-pitch"></a>Gibbor</h3>
        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>The primary role of the staff members at AHAVA Memory Care is to make sure the rsidents maintain engaging, meaningful, and inspiring lifestyles. At the assisted living facility, they are expected to put the needs of residents before theirs. To maintain AHAVA as a place to experience joy in everyday life, ownership and flexibility must be granted not only to the residents, but also to the staff members, who may potentially be the overlooked stakeholders.</p>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>Our observations/interviews showed how staff members, particularly resident care assistants found difficulty in handling one-on-one resident care responsibilities as well as activity sessions that they aren't assigned to. While they feel underappreciated and overworked, they must patiently interact with residents, who are sometimes reluctant to follow guidance (such as not wanting to eat or be moved). In addition, there are many spaces in the residence that could be utilized. How might we create a space in AHAVA for employee recognition and appreciation without requiring them to input more work?</p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>Gibbor is our solution to make staff feel more appreciated by structuring employee-centered events based around hobbies or passions that individual staff members are personally interested in. This allows them to share their passions and hobbies with residents and form deeper connections, while promoting appreciation and recognition from family and residents. We aim to avoid creating more work for employees by integrating the schedule of these activities with existing programs at AHAVA. Ideally, we would like to designate an inviting space (using one of the underused spaces) for staff/family/residents to gather and partake in these events.</p>
