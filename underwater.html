    		<h2>(Design process documentation in progress)</h2>
    		<p>In 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming, I learned some introductory concepts in computer science, and learned to do object-oriented programming, create run-time efficient algorithms in Python. I used the programming knowledge gained, with a Model-View-Control framework, to develop and design this single-player PC game.</p>

			<h3><a name="process"></a>Project Proposal</h3>
			<p>My program will be a side-scrolling game based on a underwater setting where the user will navigate through and interact with randomly and purposefully generated predators/obstacles to win.

			As the player advances in level and scores higher, the predator entities become more complex and sophisticated in their interaction with the user to create a more challenging experience until the player achieves a certain level of criteria and wins.

			I will not use any other modules besides tkinter to create this program. I hope to randomize the details, but overall have levels and a sense of a path in my game that makes it an ideal balance between strictly hardcoded games and soley score-based repetitive side scrollers. 

			In order to have the player interact with more complex obstacles/ predators as the level goes up, I may need to implement AI to make the game more interactive.</p>

		<h3>Project Design (Written in 2016)</h3>
		<p>My program is a side-scrolling shooter game based on an underwater theme, with increasing difficulty as the user nears the end of the game. The player is given a basic ability (blue bubbles), as well as health and time. As the player progresses throughout the game, the difficulty increases, and the density and strength of the obstacles (fish; two types) increases. As they are able to hit more, the user is able to increase their health and ability levels as well as time. To solve this issue, I had to manage many issues such as the constant movement of the obstacles, the bullets/bubbles, etc. Mostly, the problem of the physics of the moving user was the most difficult. Rather than allowing the user to control the player by key presses, I made velocities that would affect the position of the player as the time went by, that would be affected by the key presses. I made classes for the user, fish, bubbles, and thecorals so that they could change in property and be randomized. My project was similar in other games such as super mario bros and flappy bird in some aspects, but had a specific design- so that there would be a set path and goal, and increasing "levels" that are based on the path and location of the user, but like how the pipes are randomized in location in flappy bird, the location of the incoming predators are randomized, as well as the design of the fractals. As the player nears the end of the game, the design darkens and the amount of infected fish increase in comparison to the healthy fish. The bars at the bottom of the screen allow the user to see how much health, time, and ability points they have in a streamlined design that is easier to understand than just numbers. The user is also able to see their progress in the game through the bar/map in the center-bottom of the window, which is marked by orange lines to indicate the changing phases. What was good about flappy bird was that it saved space by randomizing the pipes, but it did not have a specific end goal, which made it too simple. Also, the user was not able to scroll backwards or have a specific location that affected the difficulty of the game. However, this is implemented in super mario bros, although it is limited by how the difficulty increases are more hardcoded. My game 
		combined these two aspects on a spectrum. </p>
